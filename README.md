# IRIS-DATA-ANALYSIS-
This project applies machine learning techniques to the Iris dataset, a widely used benchmark in classification problems. The dataset consists of 150 flower samples across three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—described by four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
