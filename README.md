# IRIS-DATA-ANALYSIS-
This project applies machine learning techniques to the Iris dataset, a widely used benchmark in classification problems. The dataset consists of 150 flower samples across three species‚ÄîSetosa, Versicolor, and Virginica‚Äîdescribed by four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
# Iris Dataset Classification üå∏

## üìå Overview  
This repository demonstrates iris flower classification using the classic **Iris dataset**.  
The dataset contains 150 samples with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and a target species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.  

The notebook covers the full **ML workflow**:  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Model training with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM  
- Model evaluation using accuracy and F1-score
